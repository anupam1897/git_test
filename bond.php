<br>
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT''), OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE OR FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS.

<br>
(iii)	Cornell is sufficiently knowledgeable and experienced in financial matters so as to be able to evaluate the risks and merits of its investment in Company Shares and is able to bear the economic risk of loss of its entire investment
 <br>
in Company Shares. Cornell is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 (a) promulgated under the Securities Act.
<br>
(iv)	Cornell has been advised that the Company Shares to be received by it pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been registered under the Securities Act or under the "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction and that Company, in issuing such Company Shares to Cornell pursuant to this Agreement, is relying upon, among other things, the representations and warranties of Cornell contained in this Section 6.1.
